You can use it for writing Electron apps, cause setting up the electron from scratch is such a doodeedoo thing

# How to use
It has no ```node_modules```, so to begin using it you need to type ```npm install```.
After installing all dependencies, type ```npm run start``` in console to launch the Electron app.
