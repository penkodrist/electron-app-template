**Figma client app**

**0.1.1 Beta**

Current problems:
- 
- When maximized, Figma app overflow window's borders and being cropped.
- If window is resized, and Figma site is not loaded yet, size of the Figma site is bugged, in most cases - having a very small dimensions.

Features in dev:
- 
- Settings window, where user can select the desired options. Some of them: app is being hidden in tray or being started already maximized.
- Window control buttons simplifying.
